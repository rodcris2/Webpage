                <p>This project focused on using R studio to tidy Covid 19 data between 4 different csv
                files that was given. Need to condense the files to better visualize what is happening
                in the data and to be able to create a bubble plot of the number of deaths per cases 
                around various countries.</p>

                to send messages to the server side and will display how long it took to recieve 
                the message. Also created a pulse mointer system in which the server will send a 
                message to the client everytime it reads a pulse within a 10sec time frame or else 
                the server quits.</p>

                <p>The project used python libraries such as “http.server”, “http.client”, 
                “socketserver”, etc to connect to an API and server to filter profanity. 
                The project works by connecting to FOAAS and passing the message to PurgoMalum 
                which will filter the profanity. This is then returned to the user in the form 
                of an HTML page.</p>
